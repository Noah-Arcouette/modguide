This tutorial is for people in my MineCraft server, and is useless for people not in the server's discord.


Installation
============

Requirements
------------

It is assumed that you are using the [Official MineCraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/). Installation on other launchers may very. 

Java
----

First we need to install Java, if it's not already installed.

Navigate to the URL `https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-windows` in a web browser. Download the executable labeled `x64 Installer`. After the download completes, run the executable.

------

Download `fabric.jar` from this repository. Once the download completes run the file using Java. Select MineCraft version `1.19.2` keep the rest as default.
